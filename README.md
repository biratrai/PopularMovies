# Popular Movies App
This is a sample app to demonstrate various Android apis. 

Popular Movies Android app is using the material design with support library and design library.

The data is coming [from moviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) using the [discover apis](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

It  is a basis to learn the android support library for design and the new [Android Architecture Component](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html).

## The Android Apis used:
This project mainly is concerned with [Android Architecture Component](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html) as a whole.
* [Lifecycle Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle.html) - These components provide constructs to tie core components to android lifecycle events.
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata.html) - Is an observable lifecycle-aware data holder class.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel.html) - Is a helper class that contains UI data for activity or fragment to separate view logic from controller logic.
* [Data Persistence](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html) - This is a [Room Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html) to simplify sqlite with object-mapping abstraction layer.
